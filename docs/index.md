# Roblox 2016 Source code

this is a fixed version of roblox.7z (ROBLOX 2016 src)

THIS FIXED VERSION IS NOT MADE BY ME! THIS IS A REUPLOAD OF (yungdooms)HIS REPO WHICH HE DELETED/PRIVATED



## Problems with source code
- Undo/Redo does not handle `Color3` properties accurately; they often revert to the nearest `BrickColor` value.
- This can lead to inconsistencies, especially with `BodyColors`.
